# This file provides an abstraction over parts of the Bazel API. It is
# intended to be stable across Bazel's breaking API changes so that rules_go
# can support a wider range of Bazel versions.
#
# The compatibility layer is implemented with a repository rule used to provide
# @io_bazel_rules_go_compat, which is declared by go_rules_dependencies.
# The repository has one file, compat.bzl, which is a symbolic link
# to a file in this directory. The destination of the symbolic link is
# determined by the current Bazel version. Each version of compat.bzl contains
# the same definitions but with different implementations. The version names
# like v18.bzl indicate the minimum version of Bazel for that file.
